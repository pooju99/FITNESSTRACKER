## 🧠 Overview
This log records how AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) were used during the development of the **Fitness Tracker App**.  
AI was used strictly for **learning, debugging, and design guidance**, not for generating the full codebase.  
All final implementations were written, tested, and customized manually.

## 🗓️ AI Interaction Log

| Date | AI Tool Used | Purpose | Key Outcome |
|------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Oct 18, 2025** | ChatGPT (GPT-5) | Faced build issues with Gradle and dependency mismatches in `pubspec.yaml` | Understood SDK compatibility and fixed desugaring setup for Android builds |
| **Oct 19, 2025** | ChatGPT | Sought guidance on improving app UI/UX design for multiple screens | Learned to maintain consistent theming and responsive layouts using gradients and reusable widgets |
| **Oct 20, 2025** | ChatGPT | Needed help integrating local data persistence | Learned how to use `SharedPreferences` for offline storage and serialize data using JSON |
| **Oct 21, 2025** | ChatGPT | Debugged issues while tracking streaks, goal progress, and updating dashboard summaries | Gained insights into state management, widget refresh logic, and improving user engagement |
| **Oct 22, 2025** | ChatGPT | Clarified best practices for documentation, testing, and presentation organization | Improved understanding of Flutter project structure, debugging workflow, and how to clearly explain functionality |

## 💡 How AI Was Used
- **Learning Aid:** Used ChatGPT to understand Flutter widget lifecycles, state management, and data persistence.  
- **Debugging Partner:** Helped interpret build and runtime errors, version mismatches, and Gradle configuration issues.  
- **Design Advisor:** Suggested layout improvements, color palettes, and responsive UI strategies.  
- **Documentation Support:** Provided examples of structured writing for reports, testing documentation, and presentation slides.

## 🧩 Reflection
> “AI tools acted as supportive learning assistants rather than replacements for original development work.  
> They guided me through troubleshooting and refining app structure while improving my confidence in handling Flutter development independently.  
> The process deepened my understanding of local storage, UI consistency, and cross-platform optimization.”

---

## ✅ Compliance Statement
I confirm that:
- AI tools were used **ethically and transparently**, only for learning and debugging purposes.  
- The **entire final code, logic, and testing** were implemented manually.  
- This log fulfills the **AI Transparency requirement** as per academic integrity guidelines.
